# Stitchfy Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Architecture Foundation ✅ done

- Core contracts: `SolutionContext`, `StitchfyCapability`, generic `Agent`,
  `ImplementationArtifact`, `Provider`.
- `CapabilityRegistry` + `createDefaultRegistry()`.
- `SolutionBlueprint` v1 types + Zod schema.
- Business discovery (`BusinessContext` + a real deterministic extraction
  agent).
- Governance/HITL domain model (`HumanApprovalRequest`, policies,
  guardrails, audit logger wired into the capability runner).
- 8 capability module skeletons; **website** fully wired as a real adapter
  over the existing pipeline, the other 7 as typed placeholders with
  keyword-heuristic `supports()`.
- New `solution-orchestrator.ts` + `npm run solution` CLI, additive
  alongside the untouched `orchestrator.ts` + `npm run stitchfy`.
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (this roadmap's companion).

## Phase 1 — Business Discovery ✅ done

- `DiscoveryResult` (`framework/discovery/discovery-result.types.ts`) as the
  new source of truth; `BusinessContext` kept shape-compatible as a derived
  projection (`deriveBusinessContext`) so Phase 0's 7 keyword-matching
  capabilities needed zero edits.
- Provenance (`framework/core/contracts/provenance.ts`:
  `SourceReference`/`DiscoveryMetadata`) on every discovery entity —
  explicit vs. deterministically-derived is always distinguishable; nothing
  is silently presented as a fact it isn't.
- Real, deterministic extraction for goals, pain points, desired outcomes,
  actors, business processes (a general blank-line/label-chunk parser —
  `processes.extractor.ts`), requirements (explicit-section-or-derived),
  system inventory (deterministic category classification, never-guessed
  technology), constraints, business rules, data entities, and integration
  needs. `framework/discovery/{processes,systems,constraints,requirements}/`
  are no longer empty stubs.
- `InformationGap` model + deterministic gap detection
  (`information-gaps.extractor.ts`), including a data-sensitivity gap when
  customer data is mentioned without an explicit Data section.
- `TraceabilityLink` model + extraction from relation IDs already present on
  typed objects (`traceability.extractor.ts`) — zero dangling links,
  covered by tests.
- `SolutionBlueprint.{requirements,processes,actors,systems,constraints}`
  are now populated from real discovery output; added optional
  `businessRules`/`informationGaps`/`traceability` fields (schemaVersion
  stays "1.0" — purely additive).
- New example `examples/solution/appointment-business.md` + `npm run test`
  (Node's built-in test runner) covering the 8 scenarios from the Phase 1
  task — see `tests/discovery.test.ts`.
- LLM enrichment extension point documented (ARCHITECTURE.md), not wired to
  a call site — see Phase 1.5.
- Capability `supports()` heuristics were **not** changed — see Phase 1.5
  and ARCHITECTURE.md "Capability Selection Evolution".

## Phase 1.5 — Solution Planning and Traceability

Deliberately deferred out of Phase 1:

- Requirement ↔ process correlation (`RequirementItem.relatedProcessIds` is
  always `[]` today; no fuzzy matching was attempted).
- A `relatedOutcomeIds`-style field so a derived requirement traces back to
  the `DesiredOutcome` it came from with a `"derived-from"` link.
- Constraint cross-referencing to processes/requirements.
- Actually wiring an LLM enrichment call behind `framework/providers/llm/`
  (the extension point is typed/documented, not implemented).
- An interactive gap-resolution flow (`InformationGap` is data-only today).
- Updating any capability's `supports()` to read `SolutionContext.discoveryResult`
  instead of `businessContext` keyword matching (see the evolution table in
  ARCHITECTURE.md) — first candidate to actually do this should be whichever
  capability is picked for Phase 3+.

## Phase 2 — Website Capability Migration

- Move `framework/agents/*`, `site-generator.ts`, `stitch-generator.ts`
  under `framework/capabilities/website/{agents,generators,validators}/`
  without changing behavior.
- Decide whether `WebsiteBlueprint` becomes a capability-owned schema
  referenced by `SolutionBlueprint`, or stays fully independent.

## Phase 3 — Workflow Automation

- Real `triggers`/`steps`/`decisions`/`approvals` derivation from
  `DiscoveryResult.processes` (now structured, per Phase 1) instead of the
  flat `BusinessContext.processes` string list.
- First real use of `framework/governance/approvals` from a capability
  output (workflow approval steps).

## Phase 4 — Integration Architecture

- Real REST/webhook/SaaS integration derivation from
  `BusinessContext.integrations` + `existingSystems`.
- First real `IntegrationProvider` implementation
  (`framework/providers/integrations/`).

## Phase 5 — AI Agent Architecture

- Real `AIAgentDefinition` generation: tool specs, memory strategy,
  guardrails, confidence/risk thresholds.
- Wire `humanApproval` generation into `framework/governance/approvals`
  end-to-end (not just the type).

## Phase 6 — Security / Governance

- Real `security-governance.capability.ts` output derived from
  `DiscoveryResult.businessRules`/`constraints`/`dataEntities` (using
  `dataEntities[].sensitive`, already computed in Phase 1) plus the existing
  `detectComplianceFlags`-style pattern from `intake.agent.ts`.
- Real `RiskAssessment[]` in `planning/risk-assessment/risk-assessment.ts`
  instead of an empty stub.

## Phase 7 — Cloud / Observability

- First concrete `CloudProvider` adapter (behind
  `framework/providers/cloud/`, vendor selectable, not hardcoded).
- Real logging/metrics/tracing/alerting recommendations tied to whichever
  capabilities are active in a given solution.

## Phase 8 — Legacy Modernization

- Real system inventory + migration-candidate derivation.
- First use of `SystemInventoryItem` populated from actual discovery input
  rather than manual/empty.

## Phase 9 — Reference Implementations

- One worked example per non-website capability under `examples/`, and a
  matching template under `templates/`, once that capability has a real
  `execute()`.
- End-to-end docs walkthrough: project.md → solution-blueprint.v1.json →
  generated artifacts for at least one non-website capability.
